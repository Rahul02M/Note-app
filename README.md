# NOTEPAD‚úçÔ∏è

1. Introduction
    - In this project, i build a NotePad website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for (fornt-end) and asp.net core web api(Back-end) . The goal is to understand the mechanics of how ASP.NET Core Web Api servers work together with the front-end. An API stands for Application Programming Interface. It‚Äôs like a bridge that allows different software programs to communicate with each other.üöÄüåü

2. Front-End and Back-End Basics:
     - Front-End:This refers to the client side‚Äîthe user interface (UI)üíª that users interact with.HTML,CSS,JS and Common frameworks include ReactJS, VueJS, and Angular.<br>
     - Back-End: This handles server-side tasks like authentication, data fetching, and business logic. Frameworks like NodeJs, Django, and ASP.NET are used here.
       
3. Connecting Front-End and Back-End:üåê
   - Regardless of the chosen architecture, communication between front-end and back-end follows similar principles.
   - Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre NOTEPAD:<br>
         - You choose Angular (front-end) and Nodejs  (back-end).<br>
         - I choose HTML, CSS , JS and ASP.NET (back-end).<br>
   - Both approaches achieve the same goal, but with different languages.

4. Creating an ASP.NET Core Web API:
    - You can build a controller-based web API that uses a database:<br>
         - Create a new project using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.<br>
         - Choose the ASP.NET Core Web API template.<br>
         - Add NuGet packages (e.g., Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory) for database support.<br>
         - Test the project using Swagger (automatically generated API documentation).<br>
5. Usage
