# NOTEPAD✍️

1. Introduction
    - In this project, i build a NotePad website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for (fornt-end) and asp.net core web api(Back-end) . The goal is to understand the mechanics of how ASP.NET Core Web Api servers work together with the front-end.🚀🌟

2. Front-End and Back-End Basics:
     - Front-End:This refers to the client side—the user interface (UI)💻 that users interact with.HTML,CSS,JS and Common frameworks include ReactJS, VueJS, and Angular.<br>
     - Back-End: This handles server-side tasks like authentication, data fetching, and business logic. Frameworks like NodeJs, Django, and ASP.NET are used here.
       
3. Connecting Front-End and Back-End:🌐
   - Regardless of the chosen architecture, communication between front-end and back-end follows similar principles.
   - Let’s say we’re NOTEPAD:
         - You choose Angular (front-end) and Nodejs  (back-end).
         - I choose HTML, CSS , JS and ASP.NET (back-end).
  - Both approaches achieve the same goal, but with different languages.
